*** Questions ***

we have 2 user types: Admin and Employee, Menu and UI pages are different for these roles, how to handle these ? Have a base page class with common elements
and inherit like AdminDashboard and EmployeeDashboard or have one big class with everything and use whenever you need what ?

seconds approach might have issues if same element behaves differently, e.g. same button opens different pages/forms, which may happen realistically.
